# ShowTime
#### aka the passive aggressive timer

Time management for live performance slots. 

(or if you just need a really big clear readable timer!)

No longer will you be asked the question "How much time do we have left?" or "Can we do an encore?" :-p

ShowTime will help guilt-trip your live performers into finishing ON TIME!
